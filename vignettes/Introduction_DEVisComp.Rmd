## Introduction

Differential expression analysis is a typical step when analyzing the RNA-sequencing data, which compare the expression levels between different experimental groups and discover quantitative changes. For example, we can perform differential expression analysis on wild-type samples and samples with certain mutation to investigate which genes are affected by the mutation.

There are many methods for differential expression analysis. DESeq and edgeR are two commonly used methods which are based on negative binomial distributions (Love et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2010). By feeding them the count data of the samples, they perform statistical analysis to discover the quantitative changes and output the log-fold change of the expression level and the statistical significance of that change.

`DEVisComp` is an R package for visualizing and comparing the differential expression analysis results from R packages DESeq2 and edgeR. This package provide different plots such as MA plots and Venn diagrams comparing the differntially expressed genes data generated by DESeq2 and edgeR. It can also be used to visualize the pattern of gene expression together with log-fold change and adjusted p-values. In order for the result to be meaningful, the package assumes the results from DESeq2 and edgeR should be created with similar parameters.

`DEVisComp` contains 1 functions to visualize the expression analysis results and 3 functions to compare the results created by DESeq2 and edgeR. The *ClusterTogether* function generates 3 heatmaps side-by-side showing the patterns among gene expression, log-fold changes, and adjusted p-values of the differntially expressed genes. The *compVenn* is the function that create a Venn diagram comparing the genes that are marked as differentially expressed by DESeq2 and edgeR. The *compMA* and *compVolcano* generate MA plots and Volcano plots respectively for results created by DESeq2 and edgeR.

## Quick Start

### Set up
There are 4 functions in the package, and all functions require DESeq2 and/or edgeR outputs as correct inputs. We first used the airway dataset in the package to perform the differential gene expression analysis with standard workflow of DESeq2 and edgeR with similar parameters.


```
  # DESeq2 workflow
  if (! requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
  }
  
  if (! requireNamespace("DESeq2", quietly=TRUE)) {
    BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
  }
    
  dds <- DESeq2::DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=airwayCounts,
                                        colData=airwayMetadata,
                                        design=~dex,
                                        tidy=TRUE)
  dds <- DESeq2::estimateSizeFactors(dds)
  
  # get the normalized counts
  deseq2NormalizedCounts <- DESeq2::counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)

  dds@colData$dex <- relevel(dds@colData$dex, ref = "control")
  dds <- DESeq2::DESeq(dds, quiet = TRUE)
  res <- DESeq2::results(dds, tidy=TRUE)
  
  # get the reuslt we need as input
  deseq2Result <- DESeq2::lfcShrink(dds, coef = "dex_treated_vs_control",
                                     type = "apeglm", quiet = TRUE)
```

```
  # edgeR workflow
  if (! requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
  }
  
  if (! requireNamespace("edgeR", quietly=TRUE)) {
    BiocManager::install("edgeR")
  }
  
  if (! requireNamespace("statmod", quietly=TRUE)) {
    install.packages("statmod")
  }
  
  counts <- data.frame(airwayCounts[,-1], row.names = airwayCounts$ensgene)
  diffList <- edgeR::DGEList(counts, samples = airwayMetadata)
  
  # get the normalized counts
  edgerNormalizedCounts <- edgeR::cpm(diffList, normalized.lib.sizes = TRUE)
  
  dex <- factor(rep(c("control", "treated"), 4))
  design <- model.matrix(~dex)
  rownames(design) <- colnames(diffList)
  diffList <- edgeR::estimateDisp(diffList, design, robust = TRUE)
  
  fit <- edgeR::glmFit(diffList, design)
  lrt <- edgeR::glmLRT(fit)
  
  # get the reuslt we need as input
  edgerResult <- edgeR::topTags(lrt, n = dim(lrt)[1])$table
```

### ClusterTogether
The __*ClusterTogether*__ function generates 3 heatmaps side-by-side showing the patterns among gene expression, log-fold changes, and adjusted p-values of the differntially expressed genes. More information could be viewed in `?ClusterTogether`.

<br>

We plot the heatmaps with the results from DESeq2:
```
ClusterTogether(normalizedCounts = deseq2NormalizedCounts,
                             DEResult = deseq2Result,
                             tool = "DESeq2")
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="ClusterTogether_DESeq2_example.png" alt="ClusterToghther_DESeq2_example" width="450" height="600"/></div>

For all heatmaps, each row represents a gene. The order of the rows if all three heatmaps are consistent.

The left heatmap shows the log-3 normalized counts for each sample, where column 1, 3, 5, 7 are the controls from 4 cell lines and column 2, 4, 6, 8 are the corresponding treatments. The heatmap in the middle shows how expression changed for each gene. Positive log2-fold change (LFC) means the expression increases from control to treatment and negative value means the expression decreases. The right heatmap shows the adjusted pvalue (padj) which indicates the significance of the change.

Overall, genes in the upper half of the plots have higher expression (darker red in the first heatmap) and are up-regulated in the treatment (positive LFC), and genes in the lower half have lower expression (lighter color in the first heatmap) and are down-regulated (negative LFC). The down-regulated genes are relatively more significant overall (Darker color in the lower half of the third heatmap overall). 

<br>

Another example using the results from edgeR:
```
ClusterTogether(normalizedCounts = edgerNormalizedCounts,
                             DEResult = edgerResult,
                             tool = "edgeR")
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="ClusterTogether_edgeR_example.png" alt="ClusterToghther_edgeR_example" width="450" height="600"/></div>

### compVenn
The __*compVenn*__ is the function that create a Venn diagram comparing the genes that are marked as differentially expressed by DESeq2 and edgeR. More information could be viewed in `?compVenn`.

```
compVenn(deseq2Result = deseq2Result,
         edgerResult = edgerResult,
         cutoff = 0.05)
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="compVenn_example.png" alt="compVenn_example" width="300" height="300"/></div>

From this venn diagram, we saw that DESeq2 gave more differentially expressed genes than edgeR. Most genes edgeR detected as differentially expressed are also detected by DESeq2, but we still got some genes that are uniquely detected by DESeq2 or edgeR.

### compMA
The __*compMA*__ generate MA plots for results created by DESeq2 and edgeR. More information could be viewed in `?compMA`.

```
compMA(deseq2Result = deseq2Result,
         edgerResult = edgerResult,
         cutoff = 0.05)
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="compMA_example.png" alt="compMA_example" width="800" height="300"/></div>

From both plots, we can see that genes that are uniquely detected by edgeR (red points) tends to have low expression, and genes that are uniquely detected by DESeq2 (yellow points) tends to have lower padj value.

### compVolcano
The __*compVolcano*__ generate Volcano plots for results created by DESeq2 and edgeR. More information could be viewed in `?compVolcano`.

```
compVolcano(deseq2Result = deseq2Result,
         edgerResult = edgerResult,
         cutoff = 0.05)
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="compVolcano_example.png" alt="compVolcano_example" width="800" height="300"/></div>

From the left plot, we can see that genes that are uniquely detected by DESeq2 (yellow points) tends to have lower padj value (consistent with what we got from the MA plots) regardless of the LFC. From the right plot, we can see that edgeR tends to grab some genes with very large LFC and assigns them a relatively good padj value.
